# Syntax
Alpha is mainly inspired by Julia and Python.
The syntax is more wordy than C-like languages and we use line breaks to
delimit statements.
Blocks are delimited by begin and end (like in Julia) though any statement
can be used in an if-else or loop structure (unlike Julia).

## Declarations
A declaration in alpha is made by the let keyword :

```alpha
let x be 2 + 2
```

Since all local variables containing data are ints, no type is required.

To declare functions and procedure, see the dedicated section bellow.

## Loops
We can declare two types of loops using the **loop** keyword.
Note that loops accepts block and non block statements for a lighter syntax.

### Loop when (while)
A while loop is made with this syntax :

```alpha
loop when i <= n
begin
    result := result * i
    i := i + 1
end
```

A block with begin and end is used because there are two instructions.

### Loop with (for)
A for loop is made using this syntax :

```alpha
loop with i from 1 to n
    result := result * i
```

Here, no block is required.

## Functions
Functions are slightly differents compared to other languages.
Firstly, there are two types of functions : functions and procedures.
The first type describes returning functions and the latter is for functions
that return nothing.
Use fun or proc to declare a function.
Then use the take keyword to declare arguments (this section can be ommited).
Lastly a block statement containing the body of the function is required.

```alpha
fun myfunction      # fun can be replaced by proc if nothing is returned
take a, b, c        # Args
begin
    return a + b + c
end
```

## Input / Output
Two keywords are dedicated for user interaction : **print** and **scan**.

### Printing
Print can display strings and numbers.
The behaviour is similar to Python's print function (1 print = 1 line = 1 space between variables).

```alpha
let a be 42
print 'a =' a "!"
```
```sh
a = 42 !
```

A string can be delimited by single or double quotes.

### Scanning
Scan can be used in two ways, the first one assigns the variable :

```alpha
let a be 0
scan a
```

Note that *a* has to be declared, on the other hand, you can use **let scan** to declare a new variable :

```alpha
let scan a
```

This instruction is equivalent to the previous code block.

## Operators
Operators are Python-like except **is**, which delineates the equality operator
(== in most of languages), and **:=** refering to the assignment operator.

| Precedence | Operators |
| ---------- | --------- |
| 1  | call() |
| 2  | _unary_- |
| 3  | \* / |
| 4  | + - |
| 5  | <= >= < > |
| 6  | is != |
| 7  | and |
| 8  | or |
| 9  | not |
| 10 | := += -= \*= /= |

### Main
Note that like C programs, the function **main** is the entry of any Alpha program.
